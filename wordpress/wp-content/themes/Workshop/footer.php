                With nearly 20 years of experience in the hobby, Collector's Exchange is one of the largest and most trusted buyers of <br>sports cards & collectibles in Indiana. Though we specialize in purchasing sports related items, we also buy coins, & <br>vintage collectibles. With our extensive knowledge base and understanding of current market values, we’re able to <br>accurately appraise the value of your collection in a timely manner. Our large network of customers and online retailers <br>across the country allow us to pay very strongly for your collectibles. We’re always prepared to make competitive offers,<br> regardless if your collection is worth $200 or $200,000, financing will never be a problem.<br><br>
                
                Our brick and mortar office is located inside the Williamsburg Center on North Oakwood Ave. Muncie, Indiana. The office <br>location is not a retail store, rather a “buying hub” for collectors and those looking to sell collectibles. Because we resell <br>our inventory to clients directly and through a variety of eCommerce (online) venues, our inventory is not offered to the <br>local public unless by appointment.  If you’re wanting to sell but can't make it to our office with your collection, we can <br>travel to you at no cost.  If a deal is reached, we’ll handle all the logistics and expenses of getting your items back to our <br>facility.<br><br>
                
                If we don't buy your collection, we'd be happy to discuss our brokering options.  Over the years, we’ve developed <br>relationships with some of the largest dealers, auction houses and collectors in the nation.  As a broker, we'll work as a <br>liaison between you and our resources to maximize the value of your collection. If you are a motivated seller, give us a <br>call today to set up an appointment, we’re looking forward to hearing from you.<br><br>
